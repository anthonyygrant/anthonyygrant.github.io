                <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
                <p>Throughout my Computer Science program and the development of this ePortfolio, I’ve built a strong and adaptable skill set that has prepared me well to enter the tech industry. My coursework has given me a solid foundation in key areas such as software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management. On top of that, I’ve gained hands-on experience in scripting, full-stack development, unit testing, and app development. What’s made this journey especially rewarding is the ability to apply what I’ve learned directly to my current role as a Systems Administrator at a software development company—proving just how relevant and applicable this education has been in real-world settings.</p>
                <p>This program has also helped me grow professionally. Working on team projects has strengthened my collaboration skills and taught me how to contribute meaningfully to shared goals. I’ve learned to communicate technical concepts clearly, both in academic contexts and in my day-to-day work. Studying algorithms and data structures sharpened my analytical thinking, while software engineering and database principles played a central role in projects like my "Travlr Getaways" application. My professional experience has also given me a practical understanding of security considerations in software development environments.</p>
                <p>The artifacts in this ePortfolio represent the range and depth of what I’ve learned. The "Travlr Getaways" project highlights my full-stack development and database skills, especially the integration of real-time updates. My scripting background has helped automate tasks in my admin role, and working with app development shows my ability to adapt to new platforms. A strong understanding of unit testing underscores my commitment to writing reliable, maintainable code. Altogether, these experiences reflect a well-rounded and practical skill set suited to many areas within the computer science field.</p>
                <p>This ePortfolio is more than a showcase of varying skills—it's a reflection of the academic and hands-on experiences that have shaped my development. With a solid foundation and a clear direction, I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and contributing in meaningful ways within the tech industry.</p>

          <h3>Initial Code Review</h3>
          <p>
            For my capstone I chose to utilize a codebase from a prior course. This video showcases that initial review of the code, and lays out what my plan is for enhancing it.

      <!-- Enhancement Blocks -->
      <div class="capstone-wrapper">
        <!-- Enhancement One -->
        <div class="capstone">
          <div class="capstone-text">
            <h3>Enhancement One</h3>
            <p>This enhancement focuses on a web-based login page that was recently modified to improve access control within a full-stack project. Originally, the admin site could be viewed without logging in, but now the login page is required for all admin site access. This change strengthens security by ensuring that only authenticated admin users can access sensitive administrative content. The enhancement demonstrates key skills such as HTML form development, JavaScript for client-side storage, and integration with Angular services.</p>
            <p>The enhancement aligns with course outcomes related to client-side scripting, debugging, and framework integration. Throughout the process, challenges such as managing session data across site navigation and ensuring proper logout behavior were addressed through testing and troubleshooting. In addition to improving site security, this artifact lays important groundwork for future features, including user session handling for the standard user-facing site.</p>

        <!-- Enhancement Two -->
        <div class="capstone">
          <div class="capstone-text">
            <h3>Enhancement Two</h3>
            <p>This enhancement focuses on refining the user registration feature and route protection system within a web application. Initially, registration was only accessible via Postman, but it has since been integrated with the login page through a user-friendly link. The route protection system uses decision-making algorithms to determine user access rights, ensuring proper control of restricted areas. These improvements required updates to Angular routing, HTML structure, and TypeScript logic to ensure seamless frontend-backend integration.</p>
            <p>This artifact was included to showcase the implementation of foundational web development practices such as routing, API interaction, and access control. Enhancing this feature strengthened skills in debugging, algorithmic thinking, and error analysis. Throughout the process, challenges included isolating routing issues and avoiding rushed code errors. This enhancement supports course outcomes related to web development and demonstrates the importance of thoughtful coding and troubleshooting practices.</p>

        <!-- Enhancement Three -->
        <div class="capstone">
          <div class="capstone-text">
            <h3>Enhancement Three</h3>
            <p>The third enhancement highlights the “trips” section of the Travlr site, which serves as the main interface for users to explore available travel packages. While a static structure previously existed, the major update was the implementation of real-time updates—now any changes made through the admin panel (such as additions, edits, or deletions) are instantly visible to users without needing to refresh the page. This improvement was achieved through the integration of WebSockets, allowing seamless synchronization between the backend database and the frontend display.</p>
            <p>This enhancement was chosen for its strong alignment with modern web application practices and its central role in user experience. It demonstrates advanced skills in asynchronous communication, real-time data handling, and database integration. The update not only met course outcomes related to innovative database-driven solutions, but also deepened my understanding of building responsive, dynamic web interfaces. Challenges included ensuring accurate, consistent data flow from database to screen, reinforcing the importance of efficient backend-to-frontend communication in creating interactive and user-centered applications.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="section-content about-layout">
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Hi, I’m Anthony — a Systems Administrator based in New Hampshire, where I live with my wife and our two cats, Moomba and Reggie. I’m currently completing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> at Southern New Hampshire University, building on a <strong>B.S. in Biblical & Theological Studies</strong> and an <strong>A.A. in Information Systems</strong> from Liberty University. I’m on track to graduate in April and looking forward to a well-earned break after that milestone!</p>
            <p>By day, I work for a New Hampshire-based company that specializes in <strong>learning management systems and compliance training platforms</strong>. While my role is rooted in IT, I frequently collaborate with our development team and work with tools like <strong>Visual Studio</strong>, <strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong>, <strong>Jenkins</strong>, and more. This hands-on exposure, combined with my academic background, has given me a solid foundation in <strong>full-stack development</strong>.</p>
            <p>I’m passionate about bridging the gap between system infrastructure and software engineering. My goal is to continually grow my understanding of modern development frameworks and better support the engineers I work alongside. This portfolio highlights my progress, showcases recent projects, and serves as a reflection of my journey through software development.</p>
